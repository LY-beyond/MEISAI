# Executive Summary Memo: DWTS Voting System Analysis and Recommendations

**To:** DWTS Producers and Executive Team  
**From:** Data Analysis Team  
**Date:** January 30, 2026  
**Subject:** Voting System Optimization and Fairness Improvements  

## Executive Summary

Our comprehensive analysis of 34 seasons of Dancing with the Stars data reveals significant opportunities to enhance the show's voting system, improve competitive fairness, and maintain viewer engagement. The current system, while functional, has notable disparities that could be addressed through strategic improvements.

## Key Findings

### 1. Professional Dancer Assignment Creates Significant Disparities

**Critical Issue:** Contestants assigned to top professional dancers receive substantial advantages:

- Best professionals achieve average judge scores of **29.40**
- Worst professionals achieve average scores of **16.65**
- **12.75-point difference** represents a major competitive imbalance

**Impact:** This disparity affects contestant success rates and overall competition fairness.

### 2. Current Voting Systems Perform Similarly

**Analysis Results:**

- Both rank-based and percentage-based systems achieve ~100% elimination prediction accuracy
- No significant performance difference between methods
- Percentage method offers slightly better transparency

### 3. Contestant Backgrounds Influence Performance

**Notable Patterns:**

- **Athletes** perform best (average score: 26.83)
- **Models** show strong performance (average: 25.00)
- **Age 25-34** contestants perform optimally
- **Australian** contestants excel (average: 27.13)

### 4. Fan Votes Can Override Judge Assessments

**Controversial Cases Identified:**

- **Bobby Bones** (Season 27): Won despite consistently low judge scores
- **Jerry Rice** (Season 2): Runner-up with below-average technical scores
- **Bristol Palin** (Season 11): 3rd place with lowest scores in 12 weeks

## Recommendations

### 1. Implement Weighted Hybrid Voting System

**Proposed Structure:**

- **40% Judge Score + 60% Fan Vote**
- Balances expert opinion with popular appeal
- Maintains competitive integrity while preserving fan engagement

**Benefits:**

- Reduces "celebrity factor" impact
- Provides more predictable performance-based outcomes
- Maintains viewer investment in favorite contestants

### 2. Professional Dancer Assignment Reform

**Immediate Actions:**

1. **Implement blind assignment system** to eliminate favoritism
2. **Rotate top professionals** among contestants throughout the season
3. **Provide additional support** for contestants with less experienced partners

**Long-term Goal:** Ensure all contestants have equal opportunities regardless of professional assignment.

### 3. Enhanced Transparency Measures

**Recommended Changes:**

1. **Detailed score breakdowns** - Release judge score distributions
2. **Fan vote transparency** - Provide percentage ranges for voting results
3. **Assignment disclosure** - Explain professional pairing methodology

**Rationale:** Increased transparency builds viewer trust and reduces perception of unfair advantages.

### 4. Adaptive Weighting System (Future Implementation)

**Performance-Based Adjustments:**

- **High performers** (≥80/100): 70% judges, 30% fans
- **Average performers** (60-79): 50% judges, 50% fans  
- **Lower performers** (<60): 30% judges, 70% fans

**Advantages:**

- Rewards technical excellence
- Maintains fan engagement for underdog stories
- Creates dynamic competition throughout the season
